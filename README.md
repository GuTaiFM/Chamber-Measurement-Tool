# Chamber-Measurement-Tool
Antenna Measurement Tool for use by Poynting Antennas

This is a tool which will be used with the new constructed anechoic test chamber at Poynting Antennas. Previously, the measurement tool was written in MATLAB. Although this sufficed for a period of time, it has become necessary to try and decouple the tool from the proprietary platform.

Requirements:
1. Visual Studio 2015 0r 2017 Community (only the basics are needed)
1.1. 
2. Github account to be able to commit changes.

The TODO list:
1. Write a flat file format for single measurements and azimuth sweeps (2 seperate file formats can be created or it could all be included in one fileformat. Single fileformat for both would be preferable)
2. Integration of Analyser and Rotator Code
3. Simple GUI
